####For English data.
####Read the file of CorpusSearch codes into an R data frame.

foo <- read.delim("allLangsEx.cod.ooo",header=F,sep=":")


####Give appropriate column names to the columns

colnames(foo) <- c("Extraposed","Position","Clause","TextOrSpeech", "Weight","Year","Language")


####Throw out all the codes that refer to tokens that are irrelevant for the study.

"Got up to subsetting"
#####Note that it is crucial to make sure empty string Year and empty string Language are not included, because this deletes codes which correspond to clauses above the clause containing the relevant token. (Language gets appended by a script later, and will get appended in the Year place, creating empty string in the last field of those codes, so excluding empty strings in the last field will likewise exclude these codes.) If you see "NAs introduced by coercion" for Year in French and Portuguese, then you've failed to exclude codes that you should exclude.

ex.data <- subset(foo,Extraposed != "z" & Clause != "z" & Position == "sbj" & Year != "z" & Year != "0" & Year != "" & Weight != "z" & Language != "")


library(gdata)


####Make sure R factor groups don't include factors for the irrelevant codes.

ex.data <- droplevels(ex.data)

"finished droplevels"

####Make sure dates abd 0/1 codes are stored as numbers, and weights

ex.data$Year <- as.numeric(as.character(ex.data$Year))
ex.data$Extraposed <- as.numeric(as.character(ex.data$Extraposed))
ex.data$Weight <- as.numeric(as.character(ex.data$Weight))

####Experimenting with cubic splines

library(splines)
library(MASS)



####Create a new variable in the data frame which will bin the data by century. The only point to doing this is to make a pretty graph of percentages across time.

ex.data$Time2 <- floor(ex.data$Year/50)*50

tail(ex.data)


####Create a new data frame for the percentage plot which averages percentages for each century. Again, this is not useful for real data analysis -- just for making this particular plot.

plot.data <- ddply(ex.data, .(Time2,Language),summarize, whet = mean(Extraposed, na.rm = T), n = sum(!is.na(Extraposed)))

"finished plot.data"

plot.data

p <- ggplot(plot.data, aes(Time2, whet, color=Language, group=Language)) + labs(y = "Probability of Extraposition", x = "\nTime Period") + geom_point(aes(size = n)) + scale_size_area(max_size=12) + stat_smooth() + scale_alpha_continuous(guide="none", limits = c(0,.7)) + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + ylim(0,1)
