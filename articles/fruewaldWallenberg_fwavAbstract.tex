\begin{center} \textbf{Optionality is Stable Variation is Competing Grammars}  \end{center}


\noindent In this paper, we take an issue which has frequently been brute-force encoded in the grammar with little explanatory content, namely grammatical optionality, and show how it can be fully explained as an effect of the interface between the narrow grammar and general properties of the linguistic, cognitive, and social systems, and the process of language acquisition. 
Thus, ours is a strictly Minimalist proposal, in the sense of \citet[][and subsequent]{chomsky1993, chomsky2001}; the phenomenon which appears as phonological or syntactic optionality is really the effect of a maximally simple derivation interfacing with other independently motivated linguistic and extralinguistic structures. In showing this, we take three types of variation which have been treated as different phenomena in the literature, optional operations, diachronically stable sociolinguistic variation, and competing grammars in syntactic change, and show how they can be viewed as a single phenomenon and unified under a general theory of categorical linguistic variation. 
Our proposal is the following: all variation and optionality between categorical variants is a case of competing grammars, or ``doublets'' in the sense of \citet{kroch1994}. 
Stable variation or optionality is simply a subcase of competing grammars in which two variants partially overlap in their contexts of use, but are also partly specialized for use, leading to stochastic behavior in the overlapping context(s). 
This situation of partial specialization is only stable over time under a very specific circumstance: when the variants are specialized along a continuous dimension of use.% which is unbounded in at least one direction (one infinite endpoint).

In this paper, we present four case studies, two syntactic and two morphophonological, which have been described either as diachronically stable variation or as optional operations: \textsl{-in}/\textsl{-ing} variation, Heavy NP Shift (or DP extraposition), [t]/[d]-deletion, and English topicalization.
Each case involves a probabilistic (i.e. ``optional'') alternation between surface variants, and we show that they are all best understood as instances of an independently attested phenomenon, ``competing grammars'', i.e. the alternation between linguistic variants which is observed during a language change in progress \citep[][]{kroch1989}.
If the variants have exactly the same function/meaning in the same linguistic environment, then the variants compete for use and one is replaced by the other over time (language change). 
If the variants specialize for different categorical uses (e.g. meanings, (extra-)linguistic  contexts), then the choice between variants becomes completely determined and the variants survive over time in their new uses (specialization). 
This much was discussed in \citet{kroch1994}, but Kroch did not address the problem of long-term stable variation (optionality), famously described in \citet{labov1989}, \textsl{inter alia}. 
We propose that the cases of stable variation are cases of partial specialization, in a situation where complete specialization is impossible because of the nature of the dimension along which the variants are specializing.
When categorical variants, such as \textsl{-in}/\textsl{-ing}, or topicalize vs. no-topicalize, are mapped onto continuous dimensions of specialization (e.g. style, or prosodic heaviness), the outcome can never be complete specialization because there is no one-to-one mapping between the variants and categories along the dimension of specialization; no such categories exist along such dimensions.
 
Furthermore, this result only falls out if specialization is understood as the result of a strategy for language acquisition. 
We propose a formal model of acquisition which incorporates the ``Principle of Contrast'', an acquisition strategy proposed in \citet{clark1987, clark1990}, building on the variational acquisition model in \citet{yang2000}.
Once the Principle of Contrast is stated in a mathematically precise way, the different outcomes of specialization (complete specialization and stable variation) are seen to fall out from the interaction between the narrow syntax, the formal acquisition model, and the mathematical properties of the dimension of specialization.
