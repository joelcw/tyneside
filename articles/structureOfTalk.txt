1) Theoretical benefits to viewing all variation/optionality as competing grammars
   a. Syntax (heads)
   b. Phonology (rewrite rules, determined by left-hand of rules, like a PCFG)
   c. Morphology (rewrite rules, Spell-Out Rules)

2) Specialization and replacement

3) Why doesn't all the variation specialize (or resolve through replacement)? How could any optionality still exist?

4) Answer, and prediction: it only exists when first, specialization has taken plance (stopping any change in progress), and secondly, the specialization is along a continuous dimension (at least -- of course, other dimensions may also be involved).
