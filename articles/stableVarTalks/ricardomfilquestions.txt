0) can the child divide the variation into contexts for sub-selection by chance?
1) could the principle of contrast *just* be the bias towards separating the variation into contexts
2) when the child divides the variation into contexts, does the rest happen by chance?
3) Or does the principle of contrast actually make one win in one context and the other in the other? plus dividing contexts
4) how does the dividing contexts apply to continuous dimensions?
5) Predictions: if 3 is right, then: specialization has to happen in *every* case, and it has to happen at the same speed per instance of variation, so thats the more restrictive HYPOTHESIS!
