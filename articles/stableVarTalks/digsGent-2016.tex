\frametitle{Some Challenges for Dealing with Bad (diachronic) Data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Resolution of our observations
	\item Time-depth
	\item Sources of noise
	\item Cross-linguistic comparison
	\item Acquisition's link to diachronic patterns of incrementation, diffusion, etc.
%	\item \textbf{In the tradition of \citep{wlh1968}, our hypotheses about the problems of language change are becoming sufficiently precise (at a mathematical level) that they are increasingly difficult to test with the data at hand, even as data becomes better.}

\frametitle{Some Challenges for Bad Data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Our hypotheses about the problems of language change are becoming sufficiently precise that they are increasingly difficult to test with the data at hand, even as data becomes better.}
	\item \nocite{wlh1968} Weinreich, Labov, \& Herzog (1968) identified, among others, the following problems for a theory of language change, which are also questions about acquisition:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{actuation} of new variants.
		\item \textbf{constraints} on possible changes (and possible stability).
		\item \textbf{transition} between language states (maybe reducible to the others?).
		\item \textbf{embedding} of the change in larger linguistic and extralinguistic systems.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Production data for linguistic research\\(e.g. parsed corpora)}
\begin{itemize}
%	\item If we want to use data from language use, possibly language use over time, then we need the following;
	\item \textbf{Linking Hypotheses for linguistic structure:} link linguistic theory to the quantitative patterns of language use, by finding clear quantitative predictions of hypotheses about linguistic structure.
	\item \textbf{Statistical Reasoning:} in probabilistic (stochastic) data, find the patterns underlying the noise (without accidentally modeling the noise).
	\item Example of a successful linking hypothesis is the ``Constant Rate Hypothesis'' \citep[][and many subsequent]{kroch1989}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If one syntactic parameter has a number of different surface realizations, and that parameter changes over time, then changes in the different surface contexts will occur at the same rate.

\subsection{The diachronic blocking effect and the Principle of Contrast}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	Variation in grammar is often described as falling into one of two categories.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Competing Grammars \citep{kroch1989}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Characterizes language change in progress via the \textbf{replacement} of one linguistic variant by another.
%			\item Competition is parameterized in some fashion, as in competing flavors of the same functional head \citep{kroch1994}.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Optionality (within a grammar?)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Diachronically stable variation between linguistic variants.
			\item Synchronically difficult/impossible to distinguish from competing variants.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\textbf{Overall Hypothesis:} all variation, including grammatical optionality, is formally \textbf{competing grammars}, with the following consequences (\citealt{fruehwaldwallenberg2013}, \textsl{In Prep}): \nocite{fruehwaldwallenberginprep}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We expect variation (apparent optionality) between multiple grammatical forms is diachronically unstable.
		\item True(er) optionality = stable(er) variation...must be explained by some aspect of language use outside of the linguistic variable itself (\textbf{embedding}), which slows the change. 
%		\item The linguistic system (and therefore the variation) interacts with various dimensions of language use, which have their own characteristics. 
%the (in)stability of a competing grammars situation
		\item We argue that it depends on the mathematical character of some dimension with which the variation interacts (\textbf{embedding}).
			\begin{itemize} \item Partial \textbf{specialization} of categorical variants along a continuous dimension. \end{itemize}
%		\item Optionality in grammar must also be parameterized. The implications of this point are greater for stable phonological variation.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Diachronic Blocking Effect}
\begin{block}{``Blocking Effect'' \citep{aronoff1976}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item General pressure against two forms existing for one function (``doublet''), forcing them to resolve in replacement or specialization \citep{kroch1994}.
		\item[ ]\{\textsl{lough, laughed}\} (laugh-\textsc{pst}; ME, \citealt{taylor1994})\\ PDE \{\textsl{melted, molten}\}\\ \{\textsl{jimmies, sprinkles}\} (candy topping, Philadelphia)
		%\item The possible historical outcomes of a doublet are replacement (one form left) or specialization (forms diverge in function).
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{``Principle of Contrast''}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A strategy that children use in acquiring language: assume that two forms have two meanings (or uses)\citep[][{ \it inter alia}]{clark1987, clark1990}.
		\item Children hypothesize that novel words also refer to novel objects \citep[as in][among many other replications of the effect]{markmanwachtel1988}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item General cognitive pressure against two forms existing for one function (``doublet''). 
%	\item This is the ``blocking effect'', as described for morphosyntactic doublets in Kroch (1994).\nocite{kroch1994}
%	\item The possible historical outcomes of a doublet are replacement (one form left) or specialization (forms diverge in function).
%	\item Crucially, they do not coexist forever, nor does one variant die randomly.
%	\item Part of the blocking effect is a language acquisition strategy, the ``Principle of Contrast'' (E. Clark 1987); \citep[cf. also][and references therein]{clark1990}. \nocite{clark1987}
%\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Principle of Contrast}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A strategy that children use in acquiring language: assume that two forms have two meanings (or uses) (E. Clark 1987, \textsl{inter alia}).
		\begin{itemize} \item Synonyms should only be acquired as a last resort.\end{itemize}
	\item Demonstrated in experiments such as \citet{markmanwachtel1988}.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item 20 children
			\item 6 pairs of one familiar item (banana, cow, cup, plate, saw, spoon) and one unfamiliar item (cherry pitter, odd shaped wicker container, lemon wedgepress, radish rosette maker, studfinder, tongs).
			\item \textbf{Control}: ``Show me one''
			\item \textbf{Test}: ``Show me the X'' (X = nonsense syllable)
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Control children pick the unfamiliar object at chance levels, but test children choose unfamiliar objects significantly higher than chance.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Blocking = Contrast + Evolutionary Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A doublet is two variants competing for finite resources, as in e.g. biological evolution.
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Instead of competing for something like food, they are competing for use (time in the mouths/brains of speakers). 
	%		\item \textbf{Selection} operates on the number of times a variant is heard (and accurately analyzed) by an acquirer.
			\end{itemize}
	\item Either one variant has an advantage, and so \textbf{replaces} the other \citep[often following a logistic function;][]{nowak2006}.
	\item Or neither variant has an advantage (or much of one), in which case random walk and drift (which can also lead to \textbf{replacement}).
	\item But in linguistic doublets, there is always the counter-pressure to resolve the doublet through \textbf{specialization}, because of the Principle of Contrast.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Doublets = Competing Grammars \citep{kroch1994}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[ ] \textbf{``Competing Grammars'', general form}: 2 variants are available to a speaker, in the relevant inventory of grammatical formatives, with overlapping functions (e.g. the same meaning).
		\begin{itemize}
			\item E.g. two featural versions of the same syntactic head. 
			\item E.g. two different output mappings for the same phonological input.
			\item E.g. two different Spell-outs of a morpheme.
			\item E.g. two different adjunction sites.
		\end{itemize}
	\item[ ] A fact about language use: at some point in the derivation, the speaker reaches a \textbf{decision-point}.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The speaker has a choice between formatives to continue the derivation, and either will result in a grammatical utterance, and a meaning close enough to the speaker's intention (the resulting meanings overlap).
		\item It is speaker ``choice'' more in the sense of an urn problem.
		\end{itemize}
		%SAY: the decision point exists because the different formatives exist, and that is competing grammars. Note that if they don't overlap in meaning, then the situation still exists formally, but there is no real decision 
		%Say something about adjunction
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Doublets = Competing Grammars}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Necessary for the description of \textbf{any} linguistic change in a categorical dimension.
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item E.g. word-order parameters \citep{pintzuk1991, santorini1992}; a phonological rule like German final stop devoicing (Fruehwald, Gress-Wright, \& Wallenberg 2009)\nocite{fruehwaldgresswallenberg2013}. 
			\item In any such case, a speaker in the middle of the change in progress (code-)switches between categorical variants \citep{kroch1989}.
		\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summary: Blocking and Contrast}
So, doublets are Competing Grammars, and Contrast plus evolutionary dynamics yield the outcomes \textbf{replacement} and \textbf{specialization}.\\
\vspace*{10mm}
Whether replacement occurs depends on whether specialization can arrest it.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Consequence: Blocking and Contrast}
\begin{itemize}
	\item If specialization occurs, its effect depends on the \textbf{domain of specialization}. A change can be:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item A replacement change in progress (outright competition going to completion).
			\item A specialization change in progress (specialization for different functions going to completion).
			\item \textbf{``Stable'' variation, or optionality:} variants have \textbf{imperfectly specialized} along a continuous (or ordinal) dimension, e.g. style, prosodic weight. 
		\end{enumerate}
	\item If categorical variants specialize along a categorical dimension, complete specialization should eventually result.
	\item If categorical variants specialize along a continuous or ordinal dimension, then complete specialization can \textbf{never} result, but replacement can be slowed by \textbf{imperfect specialization}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Loss of Relative Clause Extraposition}

\begin{frame}{A Very Slow Change}
\begin{itemize}
    \item One consequence of our overall hypothesis is that some things that didn't look like change turn out to be.
    \item Relative clause extraposition is a change in progress, but a very slow one \small{\citep[][]{wallenbergForthcoming, wallenberg2013b, fruehwaldwallenberginprep}}.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item It has been mischaracterized as syntactic optionality.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The study used the same coding query (with minor adaptation) on 7 parsed diachronic corpora (4 language histories).
    \item Both the time-depth and cross-linguistic dimensions were necessary in order to discover the change.
    \item Only because we had both dimensions were we able to observe (and confirm) the slowest syntactic change discovered to date.

\begin{frame}{Hypotheses for the diachronic study}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis 1:} Relative clause position (a binary variable) is specialized along a continuous dimension, weight, and so it should be \textbf{nearly} stable, but not entirely stable.
%            \begin{itemize}
   %     \item \textbf{Theory:} all variation is really change, competition between variants \small{\citep{kroch1989}}, of some kind.
   %     \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis 2:} All IE relative clauses derive historically from clause-adjoined relatives \small{\citep{kiparsky1995}}.
        \item \textbf{Hypothesis/Suggestion 2':} The old clause-adjoined kind are still around, in the form of extraposition, and the change Kiparsky proposed hasn't finished yet \small{\citep{wallenbergForthcoming}}.
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\subsection{Specialization for weight}

\begin{frame}{Specialization within individuals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Relative clause extraposition in the Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence  (PCEEC; \citealt{pceec}).
	\item Allows us to look at reasonable samples from individual speakers (letter-writers), as well as an historical sample from 1400--1700.
	\item Coded for prosodic weight of the relative clause, in number of words, from 0--50.
%	\item Also coded for extraposition from Subject vs. Object.
\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Hypothesis:} individual speakers treat weight as a continuous variable, with extraposition specialized imperfectly along it \citep[as suggested by][]{antonmackenzie2011a}.

\begin{frame}{Diachronically, Crosslinguistically}
\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Empirical Result:} relative clause extraposition is a change in progress.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Extraposition is dying, but \textbf{extremely slowly}.
    %    \item It has been mischaracterized as an optional movement.

\section{Competition}

\begin{frame}{What is in competition?}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item If we take the view of \citet{culicoverrochemont1990}, then relative clauses right-adjoin to various phrasal categories, and extraposition is adjunction to a higher phrasal category.
	\item A principle of interpretation (``Complement Principle'') determines how deeply embedded the interpretation can be.
	\item The doublet, the competing grammars, are actually \textbf{competing adjunction sites with the same interpretation}.

\begin{frame}{Competition? \citet{sauerland2003}}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item Sauerland argues that English relatives are often ambiguous between a \textbf{raising} structure (raising of the ``head'' NP) and an adjoined \textbf{matching} structure, based on binding Principles A and C.
	\item Interestingly, relative clause extraposition seems to be only compatible with the \textbf{matching} structure, the one that does not allow A binding of the ``head'' NP.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Competition? \citet{sauerland2003}}
 
 Can the loss of extraposition be competition between the matching and raising structures, with matching slowly losing and taking extraposition with it?\\

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Competition: matching vs. raising? }

 \begin{itemize}
	\item Can speakers choose the matching structure in order to extrapose? 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If so, then raising should specialize for in situ, matching for extraposition...why does extraposition decline?
		\end{itemize}
	\item Sauerland claims raising is bad with indefinite NPs, which is where extraposition is most natural, so raising replacing matching would have little effect on extraposition...unless this is part of the slowness, and/or part of the specialization of raising for \textsl{in situ}?
	\item And there's still competing adjunction sites within the matching structure. A 3-way competition?
	\item Is there any evidence to the learner for the matching and raising structures?
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Summary: Change in Extraposition}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Cross-linguistic Constant Rate Effect: clear for English and Icelandic changes (p = 0.47)
		\begin{itemize} \item Not so clear for Romance, though data is much sparser and the corpora are far less stylistically balanced \end{itemize}
	\item Seeing the change in all the languages makes us more confident that the effect is real in each one.
	\item The change is not at all observable without considerable time-depth.
	\item \textbf{Why the change?} After actuation, extraposition and \textsl{in situ} are competing variants in use, so there can't not be a change, even with partial specialization.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Specialization can only be partial along the (continuous) weight dimension.
		%\item Perhaps a small selectional advantage has asserted itself in the usage-overlap, but can only do so slowly because the overlap is limited.
		\end{itemize}
\item Perhaps \citet{kiparsky1995} identifies a change that goes beyond Proto-Germanic, though hard to test.
%	\item The questions we can ask are now far more nuanced, given cross-linguistic and extended diachronic dimensions.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{More Nuanced Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Any role for Sauerland's competing relative clause structures? How would we observe them diachronically?

\begin{frame}{Charles's Question (or Yang's Paradox?)}
		\begin{center}
			Experimental results on word-learning show the Principle of Contrast differentiates words nearly instantaneously. Thus, the PrinCon is too fast to produce the slow specialization we see in other components, e.g. syntax. Is there another pressure?\\
			\vspace*{5mm}
			So, is it really true that word/morpheme specialization happens very quickly? And if not, what about the experimental evidence?

\begin{itemize}
\item Variation in participle forms \textsl{gemolten, gemælted} goes back to Old English, with first adnominal use of \textsl{molten} from 1300 (OED).
\item \textsl{molten} in PDE now seems to be fully specialized (and maybe \textsl{melted} as well):
\end{itemize}
\begin{exe}
	\ex The gold was \{melted / *molten\} by the fire. \textbf{((passive) participle context)}
	\ex The fire has  \{melted / *molten\} the gold.\\\textbf{((past) participle context)}

\begin{frame}{Reconciling Experimental Evidence}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Perhaps the first generation to hear the innovation, Generation 1, does try to specialize completely, if possible.
			\item Generation 1 speakers will not necessarily converge on the same dimension of specialization (and indeed, may mix categorical and continuous dimensions as well).
			\item Generation 2 cannot help but hear true synonyms, given the overlap of use in the community.
			\item Subsequent generations may converge on one dimension of specialization (or a few, again potentially mixing categorical and continuous), but there will be intra- and inter-speaker variation all the way.

\section{Specialization in Acquisition}
\begin{frame}{Specialization and Variational Learning \small{\citep{yang2000,yang2002}}}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Identify a domain of specialization:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Actively}, by the child innovating \textsl{de novo}?
					\item \textbf{Passively}, though random sampling of finite populations of utterances?
				\end{itemize}
			\item Allow the variants different (quantitative) representations for different contexts, along the domain of specialization:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[\textcolor{blue}{a.}] For categorical variants along categorical dimensions, decouple tracked frequencies of variants for each context, C_1,...,C_n, in the dimension of specialization.
				\item[\textcolor{blue}{b.}] For categorical variants along continuous dimensions, decouple tracked mean values (or targets) of variants for the dimension of specialization.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Specialization goes to completion as the learner has variants behave differently in different contexts.		\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{3a. Specialization completes in the categorical-categorical case}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Suppose Variant A is losing to Variant B due to global selective pressure, but they begin to specialize for C_1 and C_2.
			\item Specialization completes in a categorical dimension:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Actively}, by augmenting the represented frequency of Variant A in C_1 whenever Variant B is augmented in C_2?
				\item \textbf{Passively}, by allowing whatever evolutionary dynamics hold in the different contexts play out, whether the outcome is different or not?
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{3b. Specialization completes in the categorical-continuous case}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Suppose Variant A is losing to Variant B due to global selective pressure, but they begin to specialize along a continuous dimension C.
			\item Learner allows their mean/target values for C to become distinct: $\mu$_{C_A},  $\mu$_{C_B}
			\item Specialization completes in a continuous dimension:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Actively}, by moving $\mu$_{C_A},  $\mu$_{C_B} away from each other?
				\item \textbf{Passively}, by allowing $\mu$_{C_A},  $\mu$_{C_B} the possibility of moving away from each other?
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Specialization in Acquisition: active or passive?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] \textbf{Prediction for a Strong Active Hypothesis:} once specialization begins to take place, it should be relentless, and \textbf{symmetrical}, and both variants should always survive (in the cat-cat case).
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The frequency of Variant A in C_1 is always being augmented in reaction to, and in lockstep with, the loss of Variant A in C_2 due to independent selective pressures. Both will have to survive, and:
					\begin{itemize}
					\item[\textbf{Corollary 1:}] the frequency of Variant A in C_1 and Variant A in C_2 will need to move away from each other.
					\item[\textbf{Corollary 2:}] the probability of C_1 being expressed by Variant A will rise as the probability of C_1 being expressed by Variant B declines.

\begin{frame}{Specialization in Acquisition: active or passive?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{A Weak Active Hypothesis:} once specialization begins to take place, it is relentless, but not necessarily symmetrical: if Variant A is losing globally, and C_1 and C_2 are decoupled, the amount of augmentation of Variant A in C_1 can be =, >, or < the global selective pressure against Variant A:			
			\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{amount of augmentation = selective pressure $\rightarrow$} variation is stable in C_1 and B wins in C_2.\\(THIS SCENARIO IS FULLY BIZARRE: we've now used the PrinCon to engineer stable variation.)
					\item \textbf{augmentation < selective pressure $\rightarrow$} Variant A loses in both C_1 and C_2 but at different rates.
					\item \textbf{augmentation > 2 x selective pressure $\rightarrow$} A wins in C_1 at the same rate B wins in C_2.
					\item \textbf{selective pressure < augmentation < 2 x selective pressure $\rightarrow$} A wins in C_1, but more slowly than B wins in C_2.			
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Specialization in Acquisition: active or passive?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Weak Active Hypothesis} is hard to disprove, but it may not really be testable at all:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Its implementation of PrinCon predicts stable variation, making it indistinguishable in detail from a theory without PrinCon.
				\item There's no principled way to estimate the rate/amount of augmentation in acquisition, and it could vary from person to person and case to case, making it unobservable.
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Passive Hypothesis:} PrinCon \textbf{is} the decoupling of contexts C_1,...,C_n by learners, and the rest is due to the selective pressures being different in the different contexts, \textbf{once the tracked frequencies are decoupled in the brain of the learner.}
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Specialization in Acquisition: active or passive?}
		
		\textbf{Passive Hypothesis:} PrinCon \textbf{is} the decoupling of contexts C_1,...,C_n by learners, and the rest is due to the selective pressures being different in the different contexts, \textbf{once the tracked frequencies are decoupled in the learner's representation of the variation.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Distinguished from the Constant Rate Effect by the decoupling of tracked frequencies for, e.g. Variant A in C_1,...,C_n.
			\item Contextual effects within the CRE can be thought of as transformations on a single tracked frequency for Variant A across all contexts.

\begin{frame}{Specialization in Acquisition as a Challenge for Bad Data}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This model of specialization is an extension of \citet{yang2000, yang2002}.
			\item Can we observe specialization, and the choosing of domains of specialization diachronically?
			\item Can we observe it in acquisition?
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Production data may not be good enough here.
				\end{itemize}
			\item Can we observe either well enough to test active vs. passive hypotheses?

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion: embedding and transition}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Relative clause extraposition is in decline, and we can just about link it to:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item a larger theory of syntactic representations \\(\textbf{grammatical embedding})
			\item a theory of language specialization in acquisition (\textbf{extragrammatical embedding}).
			\end{itemize}
			\item There is a level of syntactic detail that is currently beyond our/my ability to test (?).
			\item There is a level of detail in the theory of specialization that is currently beyond our/my ability to test (?).
			\item The information on \textbf{transition} is based on very high-quality, expensive data (parsed diachronic corpora, beyond the ability of an individual to produce).%which allows us to observe a lot more than we could before.
			\item It is still noisy, and we would like finer resolution as we tackle questions above, and e.g. selection vs. drift.
