\begin{letter}{\textbf{Application to Join CPT Aboriginal Justice Delegation, August 2014}}

\opening{Dear Christian Peacemaker Teams,} % eg Hello.

The decision to ask you for a place in your upcoming Aboriginal Justice delegation comes after a long period of discernment about what course of action God is calling me to, in order to work against ever increasing violence and injustice in the world. A few years ago when Arthur Gish died, I read an article about his life and began to read his writings and follow CPT's activities. I also read Ron Sider's speech from 1984, which floored me and spoke to me deeply; I've reread it twice since then, and I continue to feel that it is a call to action for Quakers as much as to the Anabaptists he spoke to. During the years since I first became aware of CPT, I've felt a leading towards becoming involved myself, which I have since tested and retested in worship.

I regret that I will not bring many pre-existing skills in nonviolent peacemaking to the delegation, but I can make a serious commitment to learning the skills that are necessary. One of my goals in becoming involved in CPT is to gain training in nonviolent direct action, and I hope that the delegation will be the beginning of that process. I have done considerable reading on the subject and discussed it with some long-time activists (notably George Lakey and Carolyn McCoy of Earth Quaker Action Team), so I have some understanding of what nonviolent direct action entails, and it is clear to me that I need proper training in order to take part in such actions.

I do have considerable academic skills, and I hope to write extensively about my experiences on the delegation, and circulate journal entries and other written pieces both within Britain Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends, various American Quaker organizations, and more widely via the use of social media such as Twitter. I also plan to hold a number of informational meetings before and after the delegation in my home meeting, Newcastle Local Meeting of the Society of Friends, and to post written pieces and photographs on the website for Newcastle Quakers.

In summary, I feel I'm being led by what Quakers call the Inward Christ to two particular actions: first, to generally get some training in nonviolent direct action and peacemaking which I can use on a number of fronts, and secondly, to put in some time risking my own life for peace and economic justice, rather than continuing to let others do so for me (as discussed in Ron Sider's speech). I hope this could lead to my longer-term involvement with CPT, but I understand that this will depend on how well I am matched to this type of work, so I am open to whatever comes of this first step.
