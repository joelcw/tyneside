\begin{abstract}
This study describes a change in which relative clause extraposition is in the process of being lost in English, Icelandic, French, and Portuguese. This current change in progress has never been observed before, probably because it is so slow that it is undetectable without the aid of multiple diachronic parsed corpora (treebanks) with time-depths of over 500 years each. In fact, building on insights from \citet{kiparsky1995}, the change may date as far back as the innovation of Proto-Germanic and Proto-Romance relative clauses, as these varieties differentiated from Proto-Indo-European. The study also shows that the unusually slow speed of the change is due to partial specialization of the construction along the dimension of prosodic weight, following the argument made at greater length in \citet{fruehwaldwallenberginprep}. Finally, the change is shown to have important consequences for the syntax of extraposition, supporting the adjunction analysis of \citet{culicoverrochemont1990}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
%Kiparsky 1995, Hopper (Hooper?) & Traugott 200?
This squib presents presents important preliminary results demonstrating the existence of a syntactic change which is many times slower than any other that has previously been reported: the syntactic process of relative clause extraposition is being lost in both Germanic and Romance languages.
%Depending on what is driving the change, it may also be a new class of syntactic change. 
As the results are still preliminary and much of their analysis is still unclear, the main goal of this article is to carefully describe a type of syntactic change which presents problems for both synchronic syntactic theory and the theory of language change, but not to present a comprehensive analysis of every aspect of this change at the present time.
Furthermore, this decline in extraposition has been underway for over a thousand years, and while it is nearing completion in modern Portuguese, the change appears to still be ongoing at the present time. That is to say, the construction in (\ref{construct1}) is currently in decline, and likely on its slow but relentless way to extinction:

\end{exe}


This simple result has the following consequence: any analysis of relative clauses (and extraposition) must take into account the fact that the extraposed and \textsl{in situ} variants are, in some sense, ``competing grammars'' \citep[in the sense of][inter alia]{kroch1989, kroch1994}; they must be in competition in language use, as one variant is in the process of replacing the other.
The fact that such slow changes exist, and that their effects on synchronic language use can be demonstrated, should cause all researchers in synchronic syntax to question whether all purported cases of ``optional'' movements are in fact changes in progress.
Perhaps ``optional'' has no coherent meaning in grammar, outside of the meaning of change in progress.

The paper is organised as follows.
First, I report quantative data that relative clause extraposition is being lost in the following languages: English, Icelandic, French, and Portuguese, using seven different parsed diachronic corpora (i.e. treebanks).
Next, I discuss the idea that the extraposed and \textsl{in situ} variants are ``competing grammars'', syntactic variants which are mutually exclusive and competing in language use, and suggest some consequences this has for the analysis of relative clauses.
In section \ref{slow}, I discuss the fact that the extraposed variant is specialized for particularly heavy relative clauses, which is the factor that slows the change down to a degree that it is only observable over a period of a thousand years.
Finally, section \ref{pie} builds on \citet{kiparsky1995} and presents the possibility that this change began back in pre-history, at a time when true relative clauses were first innovated in Romance and Germanic, and has been underway ever since that time.



\section{Decline in Relative Clause Extraposition}
\label{relclause}

The data in \ref{results} below show a remarkably slow decline in the frequency of relative clause extraposition from subject DPs in four languages: English, Icelandic, French, and Portuguese. I originally collected this data to test the hypothesis that the frequency of relative clause extraposition was stable over time in a number of languages; as you will see below, though the change is slow enough to be unobservable without data from over a period of many hundreds of years, that hypothesis can be soundly rejected.

\subsection{Methods}

It is worth noting that the type of data presented below is entirely unobtainable without diachronic parsed corpora (i.e. treebanks), which have been annotated at a very high level of accuracy (i.e. they have been hand-corrected by expert syntacticians, not only automatically parsed). For this study, the following parsed diachronic corpora were used: for English, the \textsl{York-Toronto-Helsinki Corpus of Old English Prose (YCOE)} \citep{ycoe}, the \textsl{Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English 2 (PPCME2)} \citep{ppcme2}, the \textsl{Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME)} \citep{ppceme}, and the \textsl{Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE)} \citep{ppcmbe}; for Icelandic, the \textsl{Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC)} \citep{icepahc09}; for Old and Middle French, the \textsl{MCVF Corpus} \citep{mcvf}; and for historical Portuguese, the \textsl{Tycho Brahe Corpus of Historical Portuguese} \citep{tychobrahe}.

Finite clauses containing a relative clause modifying a subject or object were extracted from the corpora using CorpusSearch coding queries \citep{corpussearch}, and coded for the following variables: the response variable of whether or not the relative clause was extraposed, whether it modified a subject or object DP, its weight in number of words, whether the clause occurred in reported speech or not, and the date of the text the clause appeared in.\footnote{If no precise date of composition was available, as was the case for many Old English and Old Icelandic texts, we used an estimated date of composition wherever possible, or a manuscript date in cases where there is no clear consensus on the date of composition. In all cases, we follow the dates provided by the documentation of the diachronic corpora, following the philological sources they cite.} These variables were controlled for in all subsequent statistical analysis.

\subsection{Results}
\label{results}

For the four languages I investigated, English, Icelandic, French, and Portuguese, there is a slow but steady decline in the rate of relative clause extraposition over the course of each language's written history (given the corpora we currently have), compared to the use of \textsl{in situ} relative clauses. This is shown in Figures \ref{engfig}-\ref{portfig}. (For data sets in the form of lists of codes extracted from the corpus, please see files ending in ``.ooo'' in the github directory linked above, i.e. \url{github.com/joelcw/tyneside/tree/master/extraposition/queriesandoutput/*.ooo}. The code lists are easily importable into R, and same directory contains queries, ending in ``.c'', which produced the codes and say how to interpret them.)

\end{figure}



As can be seen in the Figures for English (Figure \ref{engfig}) and Icelandic (Figure \ref{icefig}), the decline in extraposition is so slow that it could have been easily missed if the corpora of English (collectively) and Icelandic were not at sufficient time-depth (over 1000 years of data for each); any time-window of only a few hundred years would likely be too small to detect such a change at all.

For comparison, I conducted the same study on the Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence \citep[PCEEC][]{pceec}, which covers a period from the 15th through 17th centuries. The results of that study make the frequency of extraposition appear to be stable over time, shown in Figure \ref{pceecfig}.

  \includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{stableVarTalks/exSbjObjYearBinned50.pdf}
\caption{Declining proportion of relative clause extraposition (vs. \textsl{in situ}) from subject and object positions, Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence. N = 8073 relative clauses. }
\label{pceecfig}       
\end{figure}

\noindent The results in Figure \ref{pceecfig} match the results from the larger English corpora for the same time period (compare Figure \ref{engfig}), but miss the change entirely; simply by accident, the 250-year time-slice of the PCEEC happens to not reflect the change, which then becomes visible once we observe a larger diachronic window.

Nevertheless, fitting a logistic regression model shows that the decline in extraposition is statistically significant in each of the languages; an interaction between text year and extraposition significantly improves model fit (p < 0.00001 for all languages), controlling for all other interactions involving: matrix/subordinate clause-type, simple text vs. reported speech, subject vs. object position, and weight of the subordinate clause (i.e. length measured in number of words).

Interestingly, a model constrained to have the same slope parameter for the decline in both Icelandic and English (controlling for the same factors above) fits well, and not significantly better than a model which allows different slope terms for the two languages (p $\approx$ 0.45). This is reminiscent of the Constant Rate Effect \citep[][among others]{kroch1989, pintzuk1991, santorini1993a}, which states the different surface realizations of the same underlying linguistic object will change with the same slope as each other as that underlying linguistic object changes. Though the situation here is not one of comparing different linguistic contexts, but rather different populations of speakers (i.e. Icelandic and English), perhaps the same basic logic applies: the same trajectory of change could indicate that the same forces are underlying the change in both populations, both in terms of what is driving the change, and in terms of which basic linguistic object is undergoing change. 

However, any model which includes the French and Portuguese data fits significantly worse when it assumes the same slope for the change over time. This is true if French and Portuguese are modelled together, separately from Icelandic and English, or if any combination of languages including either French or Portuguese are modelled together (p $\leq$ 0.01 in all cases). This either means that these languages show a similar-looking, but ultimately different change (at least at the time points we are observing), or that some other feature of those data sets is obscuring what should be the same slope as in Icelandic and English. Since the text-sampling methods were designed to control for genre effects over time in the Icelandic and English corpora, but this was not done in the same way for the Tycho Brahe and MCVF corpora (and the latter is the only corpus which contains significant amounts of poetry as well as prose), we cannot rule out the possibility that the estimated slopes for French and Portuguese have been obscured by factors that are extraneous to the issue under investigation.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Extraposition As Competing Grammars}
\label{compete}

One consequence of the study above is that extraposition, which is usually described as an optional movement process producing multiple output options within a single grammar, is in fact behaving diachronically more like two co-existing linguistic objects, one replacing another over time just as in the classic cases of ``competing grammars'' \citep[][etc.]{kroch1989, kroch1994, santorini1992}. As \citet{kroch1994} discusses at length with respect to the ``Blocking Effect'' \citep[an expanded understanding of the principle first proposed in ]{aronoff1976}, situations of competing grammars are inherently diachronically unstable for general, cognitive reasons. In all four languages (with the possible exception of modern Portuguese), even though the loss of extraposition began at least a thousand years ago, the change is still in progress at the present time. Thus, the seeming optionality between extraposed and non-extraposed relative clauses is really most simply described as the code-switching that is characteristic of a change in progress (the definition of ``competing grammars'').

Thus, once two structures (or two versions of a functional head, following the Borer-Chomsky conjecture; \citealt{borer1984, kroch1994}, so named in \citealt{baker2008}) are both available to a speaker with the same meaning or function, that is a situation of competition for language use: one of two possible forms is chosen by the speaker for use in a given utterance. At this point, nothing more needs to be said in terms of grammatical apparatus in order to explain diachronic instability. Competition in use between functionally equivalent linguistic forms will be unstable diachronically by virtue of the fact that human brains prefer not to store synonomous forms, whenever possible; indeed, this is probably an acquisition strategy, reducible to the independently observed ``Principle of Contrast'' \citep[][inter alia]{clark1987, clark1990}. In other words, competing syntactic forms is an unstable situation because they are subject to the same cognitive ``Blocking Effect'' as morphological doublets such as Middle English \textsl{lough, laughed} (laugh-\textsc{pst}; \citealt{taylor1994}), in the way suggested by \citet{kroch1994}.  (For much more discussion of the Blocking Effect and how it can be reduced to independent principles, see \citealt{fruehwaldwallenberginprep}.)

But this is only true under a simple, restrictive model of grammar: if the grammar is not specifically engineered to stably produce and maintain optionality as one of its design-features, then it won't. The grammar simply produces derivations by putting atomic pieces together, and if the brain needs to choose between two pieces for the same function at some point in the derivation, that creates apparent optionality on the surface, and also diachronic instability. If, on the other hand, a grammar is specifically designed to accommodate optional or stochastic processes as part of the derivation, such as Stochastic OT \citep{boersmahayes2001} or Noisy Harmonic Grammar \citep[][and much subsequent work]{boersmapater2008, pater2008}, the something additional needs to be said in order to explain the fact that even cases as close to diachronic stability as extraposition, are in fact changes in progress where one structure replaces another.

\subsection{Consequences for the Analysis of Relative Clause Extraposition}
This basic generalization stands regardless of the specific analysis one proposes for relative clause extraposition, and must be accommodated in any reasonable analysis: the diachronic instability means that somewhere in the derivation, the speaker makes a (probably unconscious) choice between two syntactic formatives that are functionally equivalent in many environments. (Note that I do not say they are entirely functionally equivalent: I return to this point in section \ref{slow}.) The following is one possible syntactic analysis which is consistent with the competing grammars interpretation of the data above, but others are certainly possible.
%Revise last sentence, discuss Sauerland briefly, say how it implies competing grammars, then move on to culicover and rochemont after these examples:

\end{exe}

Suppose we assume the standard analysis of relative clauses prior to \citet{kayne1994}, that relative clauses are derived by null operator movement from the gap site to a specifier in the CP domain of the subordinate clause, and then the resulting CP adjoins to NP or DP.\footnote{Or to the relevant projection in the DP domain.} \citet{culicoverrochemont1990} propose that the extraposed version of the relative clause in (\ref{crex}) is not derived by movement, but rather represents an alternative adjunction site for the clause higher up the in structure.

\begin{exe}
    \ex \begin{xlist}
         \ex \label{crinsitu} A man that no one knew came into the room.

         \end{xlist}
         \citep[][23]{culicoverrochemont1990}
\end{exe}

\noindent Culicover and Rochemont then propose that a rule of semantic interpretation (the ``Complement Principle''\footnote{The name is historical: their proposal does not apply only to complements.}) constrains the possible entities with respect to which the relative clause can be interpreted; this is their analysis of the ``Right Roof Constraint'' on the locality of extraposition.

Under this analysis, relative clauses can be adjoined at a number of levels, provided they are hierarchically close enough to their antecedent DP to be interpreted with it. In fact, the generalization may be that the relative clause can be adjoined either inside the DP, or within the $v$P phase. If this is correct, then \citet{culicoverrochemont1990} should be recast in terms of phase theory such that the ``Complement Principle'' can be reduced to a requirement that the relative clause be sent to LF for interpretation on the same phase as its modified DP. But the details of such a proposal are beyond the scope of the present article. But if the analysis is generally on the right track, then relative clauses are CPs which can adjoin in at least two positions in the phrase structure, without interpretive difference. This creates a situation of competing grammars.

\subsection{Why So Slow?}
\label{slow}

At this point in the discussion, readers are likely to have in a mind an obvious criticism of the proposal in section \ref{compete}. It is well-known that the extraposed and \textsl{in situ} relative clause variants are not really functionally equivalent, as extraposition is more likely to occur if the relative clause is prosodically heavier.\footnote{Of course, I am not claiming that prosodic weight is the only factor which affects the probability of extraposition, but the existence of other effects does not detract from the main point we are making.} Indeed, this is a crucial point, because it is this specialization of the two variants for different prosodic weights which accounts for the exceedingly slow speed of this change: the functional difference between the two variants removes much of the competition between then, because it keeps at a minimum the contexts in which the two overlap in use. However, the specialization does not remove \textbf{all} of the overlap in use, so the competition still exists, and the change still continues.

The specialization of the two variants for different prosodic weights can never be complete, in fact, because extraposed vs. \textsl{in situ} is a categorical (binary) variable, while prosodic weight is a continuous one. For a full discussion of this complex and interesting issue, I refer the reader to \citet{fruehwaldwallenberginprep} where this and other cases are discussed in much greater detail, and a full theory of linguistic specialization is developed \citep[see also][]{fruehwaldwallenberg2013, wallenberg2013b}.

For the present discussion, I will just briefly mention one result which is also presented there. A study of individual authors in the PCEEC shows that their probability of extraposing a given relative clause from subject position depends on the prosodic weight of the relative clause (measured in number of words), and does so in a continuous manner: as the number of words increases incrementally, so does the probability of extraposition. For instance, speakers do not split the weight dimension into categories of ``heavy'' and ``light'', so that it matches the binary dimension of extraposition, but rather allow extraposed and non-extraposed tokens to fall along the entire scale. This is shown for the systems of individual PCEEC authors in Figure \ref{pceecWeight}.\footnote{Only authors with 100 tokens or more of relative clauses were included.}

\caption{Effect of prosodic weight on the probability of relative clause extraposition from subject position, for individuals in the Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence. Lines are loess.}
\label{pceecWeight}       
\end{figure}

To summarize, because the extraposed and \textsl{in situ} relative clause variants have specialized for different contexts (different prosodic weights), a large amount of the competition between them in use has been removed, and so the replacement of one by the other has slowed considerably. However, because the domain of specialization is continuous, the two variants are unable to specialize completely, and so some of the competition remains. Thus, the extraposed variant continues to be lost over time, but very slowly.

\subsection{Origin of Relative Clauses}
\label{pie}

The next portion of this article is by far the most speculative, as suggestions regarding the actuation of a particular linguistic change often are. Nevertheless, it may be interesting to explore some implications of the very slow rate of change shown in the data above. The change is slow enough that it may well have been in progress for some thousands of years, and so quite possibly predates the differentiation of some of the languages under investigation into mutually unintelligible varieties. In particular, it may be the case that the change in extraposition relates to the origins of Indo-European relative clauses, and that the change actually began when relative clause embedding was first innovated in Indo-European.

If we follow the non-movement adjunction analysis of relative clause extraposition in \citet{culicoverrochemont1990}, then the ``extraposed'' version of a relative clause is actually the historical form of all Indo-European relative clauses, and the ``\textsl{in situ}'' version is a later innovation. \citet{kiparsky1995} proposes that relative clauses in Proto-Indo-European (PIE) only existed as clausal adjuncts; they were not truly embedded within the matrix clause, modifying a constituent within it like its subject, but rather were adjoined to the matrix clause and associated with some correlative element within it. I will assume that the high, ``clause-adjoined'' relatives that Kiparsky describes could represent TP- or CP-adjunction, or they could easily be $v$P-adjoined; these are the possible adjunction positions for ``extraposition'' I mentioned above in section \ref{compete} with regard to Culicover and Rochemont's analysis.   These high-adjoined relatives represent either the only attested system or the dominant system found in various Old Indo-European languages, such as Sanskrit, Hittite, Old Latin (\citealt[][155]{kiparsky1995}, and references cited therein). According to Kiparsky, the low-adjoined relative clause (again, following an adjunction analysis), the \textsl{in situ} variant which appears within a DP, is a later innovation, and comes to be the dominant form in Germanic, as that family differentiates from the rest of PIE (presumably this would apply to Romance as well).

Although Kiparsky only discusses the earliest and latest stages of the change, not the detail of how the change progressed in the interim, it is straightforward to apply our understanding of syntactic change in progress to this case from other changes that have been studied in quantitative detail (going back to \citealt{kroch1989}, \citealt{santorini1989}). Starting from a Sanskrit-like system of clause-adjoined ($v$P-adjoined) relative clauses, as Kiparsky suggests, once a new, DP-embedded type of relative clause is innovated, it will come into competition for use with the old clause-adjoined system. This would create the kind of variation we have observed in all four languages, if we accept that ``extraposition'' is actually just the remnant of the old clause-adjoined relative system. Then, in order for the DP-embedded system to become dominant, as Kiparsky suggests it has in Proto-Germanic, the DP-embedded (``\textsl{in situ}'') variant would have to spread at the expense of the clause-adjoined (``extraposed'') variant over a number of generations. This is exactly the historical progression I have shown above (with the addition that the change was slowed by specialization for prosodic weight, as I have already discussed).

The idea that the high/clause-adjoined relative system has never really left Germanic and Romance, but is really simply the ``extraposed'' variants (following \citealt{culicoverrochemont1990}) is supported by the fact that clearly clause-adjoined relatives are still possible in languages like modern English and modern Icelandic. Kiparsky argues that in cases such as the Vedic Sanskrit sentence in (\ref{vediccar1}), where the ``head'' of the relative is contained inside the relative clause and the main clause contains a different ``head'' to which the relative refers, the only possible analysis is the clause-adjoined one.

\noindent Similarly, the high-adjoined system is also evidenced by cases where the relative clause refers to the entire proposition, and is, in the words of \citet[][157]{kiparsky1995}, ``unlinked to any argument/modifier position'' in the main clause, as in the modern Icelandic and English examples in (\ref{icecar2}) and (\ref{engcar2}) respectively, or the Middle French one in (\ref{frecar}):

Thus, this study has been able to build on Kiparsky's argument that the older, PIE system, consisted of high/clause-adjoined relatives, but I see no reason to conclude that they have disappeared from modern Germanic or Romance, nor that extraposed relative clauses are a separate phenomenon from the high/clause-adjoined system. Rather, accepting \citet{culicoverrochemont1990}'s analysis of extraposition as adjunction suggests a natural historical continuity: extraposition is simply the remnant of the older relative clause system (clause-adjoined or $v$P-adjoined), which has been in competition with the new, DP-internal relative clause system for well over a thousand years. But just as Kiparsky suggested, the quantitative study above does show that the old system is dying out, albeit very slowly.


\section{Conclusions}


This paper has shown that relative clause extraposition is in decline in four Indo-European varieties, and that the decline represents a previously undescribed class of language change. The change is a remarkable case in that the two variants have specialized for different functions, but this specialization has been incomplete due to the mathematical character of the domain of specialization. For this reason, the \textsl{in situ} relative system continues to replace the extraposed variant, but the change has slowed to a speed which is barely detectable. Fortunately, with diachronic parsed corpora of sufficient time-depth, it is possible to observe the change, and see that it is still in progress at the present date in all four languages.

The fact that the change is still in progress has implications for the analysis of relative clause extraposition. I have suggested that the best analysis of relative clause extraposition, in the light of the diachronic facts, is simply as an alternative adjunction position for relatives, in the spirit of \citet{culicoverrochemont1990}: interpreted lower but not moved from a matrix-clause-internal position. The high(er)-adjoined clauses have been in competition with ``\textsl{in situ}'' relatives for a very long time. This analysis has the additional benefit that it follows nicely from \citet{kiparsky1995}'s argument that all Proto-Indo-European relative clauses were matrix-clause-adjoined, and lower relatives are an innovation. This suggests that the decline in extraposition could have begun as a result of the innovation of lower ``\textsl{in situ}'' relatives in Indo-European. In that case, this is the oldest change in progress yet reported.
